# lightening-talk-Pecha-Kucha-tensorflowjs


https://hpssjellis.github.io/lightening-talk-Pecha-Kucha-tensorflowjs/




I had to make a Pecha Kucha format Lightening Talk, but normally when I am teaching once my code works I typically wing my presentation so I found making the slides kind of boring. To make things a bit more interesting I made this Gitpages website repository. It is not bad for practising your talk. If you want to use it just follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
1. Go in to "Settings" and set "Github Pages" source to "master branch"
1. Go back into "Settings --> Github Pages" and copy the new link to the top of this README.md file (I also edit the webpage link near the top of your Github repository)
1. Remember to wait about 30 seconds for any changes to showup. (I check ctrl-shift-i and look for the source to show my changes)
1. Delete my image.png files and drag your own images to the github, you might want to label them in order ie a01cool-file.png, a02smart-file.png (commit the files)
1. Change the index.html file to show your new images in the correct order. The line of code to look for looks like ``` 
  <img class="mySlides" src="my-tensorflowjs.png" style="width:100%">```
